    content: `<h2>1. Evangelion Unit-01 Ver. Ka — MegaHouse Master Grade</h2><p>Originally released in 2012 as a convention exclusive, this 1/60-scale articulated statue regularly commands ₹50,000+ at auction. Its translucent AT-Field base and hand-painted panel lines make it the crown jewel of any Eva collection.</p><h2>2. Good Smile Company — Rem Wedding Dress 1/7 Scale</h2><p>First sold exclusively at Wonder Festival 2019, Rem's wedding version shipped only to Japan-based buyers and sold out in minutes. Secondary market prices hover around ₹25,000–35,000 worldwide.</p><h2>3. Kotobukiya ARTFX J — Makima 1/7 (Chainsaw Man)</h2><p>Released in early 2025, this figure sold out globally in 48 hours.

    content: `<h2>What Is Gunpla?</h2><p>Gunpla (Gundam Plastic Models) are injection-moulded model kits produced by Bandai since 1980. They require no glue, snap together perfectly, and come in grades ranging from beginner-friendly to achingly complex.</p><h2>Understanding the Grades</h2><ul><li><strong>SD (Super Deformed)</strong> — Chibi-proportioned, ~50 pieces, great for kids and first-timers.</li><li><strong>HG (High Grade, 1/144)</strong> — The sweet spot for beginners. Affordable (₹800–₹2,500), articulated, and plentiful.</li><li><strong>RG (Real Grade, 1/144)</strong> — Advanced inner-frame detail in a small footprint. Not for absolute beginners.</li><li><strong>MG (Master Grade, 1/100)</strong> — Rich inner skeleton, panel lines, and accessories. 3–6 hours build time.</li><li><strong>PG (Perfect Grade, 1/60)</strong> — The mountain to climb. LED-lit options, 400+ pieces, 15–30 hours. Our Gundam Wing Zero Custom is an example.</li></ul><h2>Essential First-Time Tools</h2><p>You only need three things to start: a pair of Tamiya side-cutters (₹600), a hobby knife (₹300), and a grey panel-lining pen (₹350). Everything else is optional.</p><h2>Your First Kit Recommendation</h2><p>Start with an HG RX-78-2 or an HG Zaku II — both are ~₹900, have clean designs, and teach you the fundamentals without frustration.</p><h2>Where to Buy</h2><p>LetItRip lists both new and second-hand Gunpla, including rare PG builds like our <a href="/products">Wing Zero Custom</a>. Pre-orders are available for upcoming Bandai releases.</p>`,

For opened figures, the window remains 7 days — but now includes a condition-based partial refund option if items arrive damaged.</p><p><strong>Authentication Guarantee:</strong> All auction lots now ship with a QR-coded Certificate of Authenticity, verified against our seller registry. If an item is found to be inauthentic, you receive a full refund plus ₹500 store credit.</p><p><strong>Sellers:</strong> We've introduced a dispute resolution SLA; all buyer claims are reviewed within 48 hours. Sellers maintaining a dispute rate below 0.5% automatically earn a 'Verified Otaku Seller' badge.</p><h2>Graded Card Policy</h2><p>PSA/BGS-graded cards must ship in rigid mailers inside bubble wrap. Any damage in transit is covered by our ₹5,000 Shipping Protection policy at no extra cost.</p><h2>Why We Made These Changes</h2><p>Over 2,400 survey responses from our anime collector community guided these updates. Faster refunds and clearer authentication processes topped the wishlist — and we delivered.</p>`,

      "Great photos move listings faster and command higher bids. Learn how to use natural light, dioramas, and your phone camera to make your figures look gallery-worthy.",
    content: `<h2>Tip 1 — Use a Lightbox or North-Facing Window</h2><p>Hard shadows kill figure photos. A ₹500 collapsible lightbox from Amazon, or a north-facing window at midday, gives you the soft, even light that makes paint apps and sculpt details pop without blown-out highlights.</p><h2>Tip 2 — Match the Base to the Series</h2><p>Place a Dragon Ball figure on a rocky terrain texture sheet, or put a Ghibli figure on green moss. Context shots like these dramatically increase click-through rates on listings.</p><h2>Tip 3 — Shoot at Eye Level or Below</h2><p>Shooting at the figure's eye level (or up at it slightly) creates a heroic, dimensional look. Shooting down makes figures look like cheap toys — avoid it.</p><h2>Tip 4 — Document Every Flaw Clearly</h2><p>Pre-owned collectibles must have honest photos of every scuff, paint chip, and joint wear. Buyers who receive items matching the photos leave 5-star reviews. Surprises create disputes.</p><h2>Tip 5 — Include Scale Reference</h2><p>Place a coin, a ruler, or a known-size item beside the figure. Buyers need to understand size relative to their display shelf before committing to a ₹15,000 bid.</p><h2>Tip 6 — Edit Minimally</h2><p>Adjust brightness and contrast only — never change colours. The buyer should receive exactly what they see in your listing photos.</p>`,

Bootlegs show banding, colour shift, and blurred kanji.</li><li><strong>Seam Lines:</strong> Authentic figures have nearly invisible seam lines. Bootlegs show gaps and misalignment of 1–3 mm.</li><li><strong>Paint Applications:</strong> Check the eyes under a macro lens — official eye decals are perfectly centered; bootlegs are usually off by 0.5–1 mm on at least one axis.</li><li><strong>Weight:</strong> Authentic figures use denser PVC. Bootlegs are noticeably lighter and feel hollow.</li></ul><h2>Nendoroid Specifics</h2><p>[Draft — Nendoroid section in progress]</p><h2>Graded TCG Cards</h2><p>PSA and BGS holders can be verified at psacard.com using the certification number on the label.
