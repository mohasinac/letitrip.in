## 🚀 Quick Start

### To Start Working on Sidebar Search:

1. Read `src/components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx`
2. Read `src/components/seller/SellerSidebar.tsx`
3. Implement search filtering logic
4. Add keyboard shortcuts
5. Test focus management
6. Deploy and verify

### To Create a New Admin Page:

1. Check `ADMIN_MENU_ITEMS` in `src/constants/navigation.ts`
2. Create page in `src/app/admin/[feature]/page.tsx`
3. Create service in `src/services/[feature].service.ts` (if needed)
4. Add API route in `src/app/api/admin/[feature]/route.ts` (if needed)
5. Create components in `src/components/admin/[Feature]/`
6. Add TypeScript types in `src/types/`
7. Test thoroughly
8. Update this checklist

---

## 📝 Notes

- Follow existing patterns from hero-slides, categories, and homepage pages
- Use inline-edit components for table pages (see `INLINE-EDIT-GUIDE.md`)
- Use media upload with cleanup hook (see `AI-AGENT-GUIDE.md`)
- All API routes should use constants from `src/constants/api-routes.ts`
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility is mandatory (keyboard, screen readers)
- No mocks - use real APIs
- Focus on code implementation, not documentation

### Session Notes - November 10, 2025 (Architecture Fix)

**Service Layer Architecture Enforcement:**

1. **Fixed API Routes Constants Structure**

   - ✅ Removed `/api` prefix from all routes in `src/constants/api-routes.ts`
   - ✅ Reason: `apiService` already adds `/api` as base URL
   - ✅ Previous issue: Routes were duplicating to `/api/api/...`
   - ✅ Now: Routes are clean paths like `/categories`, `/products`, etc.
   - ✅ `apiService` constructs URLs as `${this.baseUrl}${endpoint}` = `/api` + `/categories`

2. **Admin Categories Page Refactored**

   - ✅ Replaced direct `fetch()` calls with `categoriesService` methods
   - ✅ Removed any direct `apiService` calls from the page
   - ✅ All CRUD operations now through service layer:
     - `loadCategories()` → `categoriesService.list()`
     - `handleDelete()` → `categoriesService.delete(slug)`
     - `QuickCreateRow` → `categoriesService.create(data)`
     - `InlineEditRow` → `categoriesService.update(slug, data)`
   - ✅ Added data mapping from service type to component type
   - ✅ Service returns camelCase (parentId, isFeatured) → mapped to snake_case (parent_id, is_featured)

3. **Architecture Pattern Enforced (STRICT)**

   ```
   Component/Page (NO fetch(), NO apiService!)
       ↓ (only call service methods)
   Service Layer (e.g., categoriesService)
       ↓ (only layer that uses apiService)
   apiService (adds /api prefix, handles auth)
       ↓ (makes HTTP requests)
   API Routes (/api/categories, /api/products, etc.)
       ↓ (handles business logic)
   Backend Logic (Firebase, business rules, validation)
   ```

4. **Architectural Rules**

   **🚫 FORBIDDEN in Pages/Components:**

   - ❌ Direct `fetch()` calls to API routes
   - ❌ Direct `apiService.get/post/patch/delete()` calls
   - ❌ Any Firebase client SDK usage
   - ❌ Direct HTTP library usage (axios, etc.)

   **✅ ALLOWED in Pages/Components:**

   - ✅ Service layer methods (categoriesService, productsService, etc.)
   - ✅ Context providers (AuthContext, CartContext, etc.)
   - ✅ Custom hooks that use services internally
   - ✅ Client-side utilities (date formatting, validation, etc.)

5. **Key Benefits**

   - ✅ Single source of truth for API calls
   - ✅ No direct Firebase client usage anywhere except /api routes
   - ✅ All business logic centralized in /api routes
   - ✅ Easier to mock/test services
   - ✅ Type-safe with TypeScript
   - ✅ Consistent error handling
   - ✅ Pages/components are simpler and more maintainable

6. **Files Requiring Similar Updates**
   - 🔄 9 pages with direct `fetch()` or `apiService` calls identified
   - 🔄 User pages: won-auctions, watchlist, settings, bids
   - 🔄 Admin pages: users, dashboard
   - 🔄 Components: HeroCarousel, SpecialEventBanner
   - 🔄 All must be updated to use only service layer
