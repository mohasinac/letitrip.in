# My Shops API Integration - Completion Report

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Date:** November 8, 2025  
**Task:** Remove mock data from `/seller/my-shops` page and integrate with real API

---

## 🎯 Problem Identified

The `/seller/my-shops/page.tsx` was using mock data instead of fetching real data from the API:

```typescript
// OLD - Mock data
const mockShops = [
  {
    id: "1",
    name: "TechStore India",
    slug: "techstore-india",
    // ... hardcoded data
  },
];
```

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Imports Updated

**Added:**

- `useState, useEffect` from React
- `Loader2` icon from lucide-react
- `ConfirmDialog` from common components
- `EmptyState` from common components
- `shopsService` from services
- `Shop` type from types

**Removed:**

- `MoreVertical` icon (unused)
- Mock data constant

### 2. State Management Added

```typescript
const [shops, setShops] = useState<Shop[]>([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState("");
const [deleteShopId, setDeleteShopId] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

### 3. Data Fetching Implemented

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  loadShops();
}, []);

const loadShops = async () => {
  try {
    setLoading(true);
    const data: any = await shopsService.list();
    setShops(data.data || data.shops || data || []);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to load shops:", error);
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

### 4. Search Functionality

```typescript
const filteredShops = shops.filter(
  (shop) =>
    shop.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
    shop.description?.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
);
```

Search input now updates `searchQuery` state and filters shops in real-time.

### 5. Delete Functionality

```typescript
const handleDelete = async (shopId: string) => {
  try {
    await shopsService.delete(shopId);
    setShops(shops.filter((shop) => shop.id !== shopId));
    setDeleteShopId(null);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to delete shop:", error);
    alert("Failed to delete shop. Please try again.");
  }
};
```

Delete button now:

- Opens confirmation dialog
- Calls real API to delete shop
- Updates UI on success
- Shows error message on failure

### 6. Loading State

Added loading spinner while fetching data:

```typescript
if (loading) {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
      <div className="text-center">
        <Loader2 className="h-8 w-8 animate-spin text-blue-600 mx-auto" />
        <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600">Loading shops...</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 7. Empty State

Added proper empty state handling:

```typescript
{
  filteredShops.length === 0 && !loading && (
    <EmptyState
      title={searchQuery ? "No shops found" : "No shops yet"}
      description={
        searchQuery
          ? "Try adjusting your search query"
          : "Create your first shop to start selling"
      }
      action={
        !searchQuery
          ? {
              label: "Create Shop",
              onClick: () => (window.location.href = "/seller/my-shops/create"),
            }
          : undefined
      }
    />
  );
}
```

### 8. Property Mapping Fixed

Updated all property references to match `Shop` type:

**Before:**

- `shop.verified` → **After:** `shop.isVerified`
- `shop.reviews` → **After:** `shop.reviewCount`
- `shop.products` → **After:** `shop.productCount`
- `shop.orders` → **After:** Removed (not in Shop type)
- `shop.status` → **After:** `shop.isBanned ? "banned" : "active"`

### 9. Image Fallbacks

Added fallback for shops without logos:

```typescript
{
  shop.logo ? (
    <img src={shop.logo} alt={shop.name} />
  ) : (
    <div className="bg-gray-200 flex items-center justify-center text-gray-400 text-2xl font-bold">
      {shop.name.charAt(0).toUpperCase()}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 10. Delete Confirmation Dialog

Replaced simple button with proper confirmation flow:

```typescript
<ConfirmDialog
  isOpen={deleteShopId !== null}
  onClose={() => setDeleteShopId(null)}
  onConfirm={async () => {
    if (deleteShopId) {
      await handleDelete(deleteShopId);
    }
  }}
  title="Delete Shop"
  description="Are you sure you want to delete this shop? This action cannot be undone and will delete all associated products."
  confirmLabel="Delete"
  variant="danger"
/>
```

## 🐛 Bug Fix: Delete Not Working (Nov 8, 2025)

### Issue

```
DELETE /api/shops/qtMj0yqwvYrUmxjPU4qw 404 in 3682ms
```

**Root Cause:** Passing Firebase document ID (`shop.id`) instead of slug to delete endpoint.

### The Problem

**API Route:** `/api/shops/[slug]` expects a **slug** parameter

- Example slug: `"techstore-india"`
- Example ID: `"qtMj0yqwvYrUmxjPU4qw"` ❌

**Old Code:**

```typescript
const handleDelete = async (shopId: string) => {
  await shopsService.delete(shopId); // ❌ Passing ID instead of slug
  // ...
};
```

This resulted in:

- Request: `DELETE /api/shops/qtMj0yqwvYrUmxjPU4qw`
- API looking for shop with slug `"qtMj0yqwvYrUmxjPU4qw"`
- Shop not found → 404 error

### The Fix

**New Code:**

```typescript
const handleDelete = async (shopId: string) => {
  try {
    const shopToDelete = shops.find((shop) => shop.id === shopId);
    if (!shopToDelete) return;

    await shopsService.delete(shopToDelete.slug); // ✅ Use slug
    setShops(shops.filter((shop) => shop.id !== shopId));
    setDeleteShopId(null);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to delete shop:", error);
    alert("Failed to delete shop. Please try again.");
  }
};
```

**Now:**

- Request: `DELETE /api/shops/techstore-india` ✅
- API finds shop by slug successfully
- Shop deleted without errors

### Key Takeaway

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Shop API routes use **slug** as identifier, not **id**

**Correct Usage:**

```typescript
// ✅ DO THIS
shopsService.delete(shop.slug);
shopsService.update(shop.slug, data);
shopsService.getBySlug(shop.slug);

// ❌ DON'T DO THIS
shopsService.delete(shop.id);
shopsService.update(shop.id, data);
```

**Why?**

- Public-facing URLs use slugs: `/shops/techstore-india`
- SEO-friendly and human-readable
- Firebase document IDs are internal implementation detail
